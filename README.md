# Week3-Project

Building an accessible image gallery
st
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
I was able to meet these requirements:

- One page, with a set of thumbnail images, and a larger image
- Styled appropriately with CSS, and make use of media queries.
- Use client-side JavaScript to display the larger image when a thumbnail is selected

I attempted these requirements as well:

- Use client-side JavaScript to navigate between images using the keyboard (tab, enter)- ✨ The document has a set of keyboard events, including keydown. This event receives an object with a .key property containing the key that was pressed. For example, ArrowRight and ArrowLeft.(I tried to incorporate this feature)
  -✨ Using role="status" like this will cause the voiceover to read out the content inside whenever it changes. Create a div, select it by id, and then try changing it's .textContext property with JS. <div id="announcer" role="status" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div>

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

I was unable to meet the following stretch goals:
-🏹 Handle user interaction with keyboard only (as if they have no mouse). You can use tab and enter/space like for all websites, but will you enable the use of the arrow keys as well?

✨ The document has a set of keyboard events, including keydown. This event receives an object with a .key property containing the key that was pressed. For example, ArrowRight and ArrowLeft.

🏹 Use your operating system's voiceover tools or a Screen Reader to have the computer announce the alt text of the selected image.

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? - Time was very short for me as i felt i was learning all over again. I am still building on my knowledge of Javascripts and its applications. - The whole project journey was a learning process for me and a very interesting enjoyable one.
